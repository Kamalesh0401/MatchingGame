## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Framework (Windows Forms)**
- **Visual Studio**


## 🎮 Game Levels

| Level   | Grid Size | Suggested Time to Beat |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| Easy    | 4 x 4     | ~10 seconds            |
| Medium  | 6 x 6     | ~20 seconds           |
| Hard    | 8 x 8     | ~30 seconds           |

> ⏱ These times are suggested goals. Players who complete levels faster than the benchmark are considered high performers.


## 📊 Score Calculation Logic

- The score is calculated based on the **time taken** to complete the game.
- There is **no fixed maximum score**—a **lower time equals a better score**.
- Timer starts as soon as the game board is generated.
- Your final score is displayed once all pairs are matched.

**Example:**

If a user completes the Medium level in `75 seconds`, the score recorded is simply `75`.

This approach encourages players to **improve speed and memory** with each level.


## 🧩 How to Play

  - Enter Name and select a level from the menu (Easy, Medium, Hard).
  
  - Select theme which interfare you like(Classic, Animals, Fruits, Numbers, Letters).

  - The game board will generate a grid of hidden tiles.

  - Click on two tiles to flip them.

  - If they match, they remain visible.

  - If they don't match, they flip back.

  - The game ends when all pairs are matched.

  - Your time and score will be displayed.
